# Jrender: A Differentiable Batch Renderer in JAX

Jrenderer is a differentiable batch renderer written in [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), which can utilize both GPU and TPU accelerators. The GitHub repo also includes [Brax](https://github.com/google/brax/) integration, therefore it can be used to replace the inbuilt rendering capabilities of Brax.
